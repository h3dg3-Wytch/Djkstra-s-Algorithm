Hello there, here are the commands you need to run this

javac Main.java
java Main (file name here) i.e java Main 25000.txt

PLEASE MAKE SURE THE TEXT FILES ARE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS THE JAVA
AND CLASS FILE. 
If you are running mac or any linux distro, you may instead enter
the ENTIRE path if it is another directory. 
If you are running windows, please, keep the files in the same directory
when you run it.
